# Introduction
This Booklet shows you how to install the dependencies that are required for the UNF AIRO Workshop that is regarded on Neural Networks Learning.  The recommendations and dependencies are displayed on the next page. You can also use the “installation.sh” file that is provided in the Neural-Networks-Learning repository to auto install the dependencies that are required for the workshop.



# Dependencies


The dependencies that are going to be used are listed here. The installation commands for the dependencies  are listed on the next page. 




* Manjaro Linux
   * https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/gnome/
